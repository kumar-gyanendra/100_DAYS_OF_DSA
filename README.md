# 🧠 100 Days of DSA — C Programming 💻

This repository contains my solutions for the **100 Days of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** challenge, implemented **entirely in C**.  
The goal of this challenge is to strengthen **DSA fundamentals**, improve **problem-solving and algorithmic thinking**, and build consistency in writing **efficient, memory-aware C programs**.

---

## 📌 Overview
- **Language:** C  
- **Duration:** 100 Days  
- **Problems Solved:** Ongoing  
- **Focus Areas:** DSA fundamentals, logic building, optimization, clean coding

## ⚠️ LeetCode-Specific Solutions

Some solutions are written **exclusively for the LeetCode platform**.

- Follow LeetCode’s **required function signature**
- Do **not include `main()`**
- No `scanf` / `printf`
- Input and output are handled by LeetCode internally

### Example
```
int* twoSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int target, int* returnSize);
```

### 🛠️ How to Use
1. Copy the solution code from this repository  
2. Open the problem on **LeetCode**  
3. Select **Language: C**  
4. Paste the code into the editor  
5. Click **Run** or **Submit**

> ⚠️ For local execution, use solutions that include a `main()` function and standard input/output handling.

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters
- Shows long-term **commitment and discipline**  
- Demonstrates strong **core DSA foundations**  
- Highlights comfort with **manual memory handling in C**  
- Reflects consistent learning beyond classroom theory  
- Serves as preparation for **exams, interviews, and placements**
