# 🧠 100 Days of DSA — C Programming 💻

This repository contains my solutions for the **100 Days of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** challenge, implemented **entirely in C**.  
The goal of this challenge is to strengthen **DSA fundamentals**, improve **problem-solving and algorithmic thinking**, and build consistency in writing **efficient, memory-aware C programs**.

---

## 📌 Overview
- **Language:** C  
- **Duration:** 100 Days  
- **Problems Solved:** Ongoing  
- **Focus Areas:** DSA fundamentals, logic building, optimization, clean coding
